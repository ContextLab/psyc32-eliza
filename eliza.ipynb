        "# ELIZA: Introduction and overview\n",
        "\n",
        "ELIZA is the earliest precursor to modern [chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot) programs, designed to carry out [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) conversations with human users in real time.  When Joseph Weizenbaum presented his [paper on ELIZA](https://www.dropbox.com/s/djldsm2jlgwvrxc/Weiz66.pdf) in 1966, he characterized it as a demonstration that even very simple computer programs can be made to appear intelligent through clever tricks.\n",
        "\n",
        "ELIZA is intended to emulate the behavior of a [non-directive therapist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy), where the user plays the role of the patient.  The user interacts with ELIZA through natural conversation; here is an excerpt from an example conversation presented in Weizenbaum's paper (capitalized responses are made by ELIZA):\n",
        "```\n",
        "Men are all alike.\n",
        "IN WHAT WAY\n",
        "They're always bugging us about something or other.\n",
        "CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE\n",
        "Well, my boyfriend made me come here.\n",
        "YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE\n",
        "He says I'm depressed much of the time.\n",
        "I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED\n",
        "It's true.  I am unhappy.\n",
        "DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY\n",
        "I need some help, that much seems certain.\n",
        "WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP\n",
        "Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.\n",
        "TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY\n",
        "...\n",
        "```\n",
        "The central idea that ELIZA is built on text manipulations of the user's responses.  There are seven basic steps to the [ELIZA algorithm](http://chayden.net/eliza/instructions.txt):\n",
        "1. First the sentence broken down into words, separated by spaces.  All further processing takes place on these words as a whole, not on the individual characters in them.\n",
        "2. Second, a set of pre-substitutions takes place.  If any of a pre-defined set of words is found in the user's input, those words are substituted for a matching set of replacement words.\n",
        "3. Third, Eliza takes all the words in the sentence and makes a list of all keywords it finds.  It sorts this keyword list in descending weight.  It process these keywords until it produces an output.\n",
        "4. Fourth, for the given keyword, a list of decomposition patterns is searched.  (A decomposition pattern is a set of words that contains a particular pre-defined sequence.) The first one that matches is selected.  If no match is found, the next keyword\n",
        "is selected instead.\n",
        "5. Fifth, for the matching decomposition pattern, a reassembly pattern is selected.  There may be several possible reassembly patterns to choose from, but only one is used for a given sentence.  If a subsequent sentence selects the same decomposition\n",
        "pattern, the next reassembly pattern in sequence is used, until they have all been used, at which point ELIZA starts over with the first reassembly pattern.  Reassembly patterns are intended to provide realistic sounding responses to common keywords.  For example, the decomposition pattern `sorry` might be replaced with the reassembly pattern `PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE`.\n",
        "6. Sixth, a set of post-substitutions takes place.  If any of a pre-defined set of words is found in the current response input, those words are substituted for a matching set of replacement words.\n",
        "7. Finally, the resulting sentence is displayed as output.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll be using a [pre-defined text file](https://github.com/ContextLab/cs-for-psych/raw/master/assignments/eliza/instructions.txt) to define the specific set of manipulations and substitutions ELIZA will make.  You'll also be provided with a [skeleton template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(computer_programming) describing how your code should be organized and what each function should do (with some functions already filled in).  Your job in this assignment will be to fill in the missing code indicated by comments, e.g.:\n",

        "Whereas ELIZA is intended to create the *illusion* of understanding natural conversation through programming tricks, cutting-edge chatbot programs attempt to explicitly model the meaning underlying human-computer conversations.  For example, the [Meena](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09977.pdf) chatbot is trained to represent meanings as [feature vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)) using [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) models trained on a large collection of documents.  The specific model that Meena uses is called [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), which was developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/about/).  A related chatbot, called [AI Dungeon 2](https://aidungeon.io/) uses GPT-2 to simulate a [fantasy role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) where the game's story is generated through human-computer interactions.  Because these modern chatbots are trained on large document collections, they are able to produce responses that leverage \"knowledge\" about a wide variety of content."

        "    - Return 2 if `a` starts with the `'@'` character and is a synonym of `b` (this requires checking each `Synonym` object in the provided list)\n",
        "  - In the main `match` function, you'll need a way to keep track of which elements of `self.parts` have been matched with which words in `words`.  This will form the `template` that ultimately gets returned.  Anything group of words matched to the `*` character or via a synonym match should be appended to the template (as a list of individual words).\n",
        "  - The trickiest part of the implementation is to figure out which parts of the inputs should be matched to which universal match characters (if any).  For example, the words `['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']` should match the template `['*', 'is', '*', 'a', '*']` via the following components: `[['this'], [''], ['test']]`.  Note that the `*` characters in the template each continue to match words in the input until a subsequent word in the input matches a subsequent part of the template.  In addition, if a `*` universal match character in the template doesn't correspond to *any* words in the input, it still counts as a \"match\" since the `*` character can match an empty string."

        "The `DebugPrinter` class can be a very useful tool.  One way to approach debugging is to add `print` statements to each class of object and/or function.  I recommend that you complete each class definition in the order it's presented in this notebook: `Sub`, `Synonym`,  `Decomposition`, `Reassembler`, `Key`, `Brain`, `ELIZA`.  As you work on each class, try the following:\n",
        "  - Create an example instance of the class with the `debug` flag set to `True` (e.g., `x = Sub('a', ['is', 'for', 'apple'], debug=True)`) and examine it:\n",
        "    - Look at the result of `print(x)` and make sure it looks like you expected\n",
        "    - Within the class definition, add calls to `self.print` to help you understand the values of different variables, and/or which instructions or conditions are being run, as your program is executed.\n",
        "    - Once you've verified that the function is working, move on to the next class definition.\n",
        "  - Try calling the different methods (functions) for that class, using example inputs.  For instance, in the above example `x.apply('a')` should return the list `['is', 'for', 'apple']`.\n",
        "  - When you try to run the full program, it's likely that new errors will come up.  Use calls to `self.print` within each class definition to check that the inputs of each function are what you expect, and that the outputs are produced correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Troubleshooting\n",
        "\n",
        "If/when you get completely stuck, some or all of the following often work well for me:\n",
        "  - Make a list of things you understand and things you *don't* understand about the problem\n",
        "  - Step away from your computer and do some laps around the room (or jog in place, or do some jumping jacks)\n",
        "  - Depending on your stress level, either drink a glass of water, eat a healthy snack (e.g. an apple), or track down some ice cream.\n",
        "  - Talk through the problem out loud.  You can do this by yourself or with a friend.  The goal isn't to \"get advice\"-- it's to help you organize your own thoughts so that you can see through your own roadblocks to understanding.  Sometimes it's even helpful to explain (out loud or in writing) exactly why you *can't* solve the problem (or why it's unfair, inappropriate, too hard, etc.).  The act of precisely explaining why you can't do something still forces you to break the problem down into pieces, which can actually help you to understand it better!\n",
        "  - If you have time, go to sleep.  Often you'll find problems are easier to solve when you wake up after a good night's rest.\n",
        "  - Try some form of mindless repetetive exercise (running works well!).  Let your mind drift-- don't specifically try to work on (or avoid thinking about) the problem you're stuck on.  Just let your thoughts bounce around in your brain for a bit while you're concentrating on something else.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also please (again) ask for help-- from me, your classmates, your friends, the Internet, etc.  Part of learning to code necessarily involves working through challenges, which can be frustrating.  But if you're totally stuck and at the point where you feel like you're not learning or \"getting anything\" out of the process, it's OK to recognize that at this particular moment in your learning journey you needed some guidance.  Asking those questions is an incredibly important part of learning too!"
